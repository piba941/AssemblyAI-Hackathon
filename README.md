# AssemblyAI-Hackathon

## Introduction:
Fake news is a type of news that is intentionally false or misleading. It is often created to influence public opinion or to make money. Fake news can be difficult to detect because it often masquerades as real news. However, there are some telltale signs that can help you spot fake news. These include:

- The sources of the news. If the news comes from a source that you dont' know or trust, it's probably not true.
